# AI-Algorithms Analysis: As part of AI module CS7IS4 taught at Trinity College Dublin.

Experiment 1:

To intuitively understand the functioning of on-policy and off-policy algorithms, SARSA and q-learning algorithms are implemented in 4*12 cliff walk environment.

Experiment 2:

To intuitively understand the functioning of DQN and PPO Policy Gradient algorithms, they are implemented in the cart-pole environment.
